        <h3>Why is making a branch important?</h3>
        <h4>There are several reasons as to why it is vital to make branches, some of which are :</h4>
        <h4>It makes your code base safe</h4>
        <p>Creating a branch would enable us to test our ideas. It gives us a copy of the code, wherein we can
          test
          our ideas without affecting the main source code</p>
        <h4>It is a good way to organize work</h4>
        <p>It is recommended to create a branch for a specific task may it be a feature, bug fix or even ideas
          that we want to experiment on!Think of a branch as a record of what was done and why</p>
        <h4>Makes collaboration easier</h4>
        <p>It allows multiple developers to contribute without conflicts. It prohibits every member from working
          on the same code directly, which can potentially
          leads to things getting messy. By creating a branch, each person has their own work environment
          where they can add or change features
          and later on merge to the main source code after testing.
        </p>
        <h4>Easier to test</h4>
        <p>It is easy for the team to test changes in a branch before merging it into the main source code.
          This is important to easily detect mistakes early , and avoid a huge mess in the main project.
        </p>
        <h4>Remote branches let others see your work</h4>
        <p>As a local branch is just on ones computer. Creating a remote branch by pushing the local branch to
          a remote branch like GitHub allows the other members of the team or others who are interested to see
          it and test it , and who knows, even contribute to it.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the git commands to create and close a branch?</h3>
        <h4> To create a new local branch from main / develop branch. It is always a good idea
          to type git checkout main or git checkout develop , to ensure that you will be creating a local
          branch from there.
        </h4>
        <h4>To create a new branch locally use </h4>
        <p>In your terminal, write:</p>
        <pre>git branch nameofthebranch</pre>
        <p>or</p>
        <pre>git checkout -b nameofthebranch</pre>
        <p>to create and switch to this newly created branch.</p>
        <h4>To close or delete a local branch</h4>
        <p>In your terminal, write:</p>
        <pre>git branch -d nameofthebranch</pre>
        <p>one might need to use</p>
        <pre>-D</pre>
        <p>if there are unmerged changes.</p>
        <h4>To close or delete a remote branch</h4>
        <p>In your terminal, write:</p>
        <pre>git push origin --delete nameofthebranch</pre>
