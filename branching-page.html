            <section class="branch_importance">
                <h3>Why is making a branch important?</h3>
                <h4>There are several reasons as to why it is vital to make branches, some of which are :</h4>
                <h4>It makes your code base safe</h4>
                <p>Creating a branch would enable us to test our ideas. It gives us a copy of the code, wherein we can
                    test
                    our ideas without affecting the main source code</p>
                <h4>It is a good way to organize work</h4>
                <p>It is recommended to create a branch for a specific task may it be a feature, bug fix or even ideas
                    that we want to experiment on!Think of a branch as a record of what was done and why</p>
                <h4>Makes collaboration easier</h4>
                <p>It allows multiple developers to contribute without conflicts. It prohibits every member from working
                    on the same code directly, which can potentially
                    leads to things getting messy. By creating a branch, each person has their own work environment
                    where they can add or change features
                    and later on merge to the main source code after testing.
                </p>
                <h4>Easier to test</h4>
                <p>It is easy for the team to test changes in a branch before merging it into the main source code.
                    This is important to easily detect mistakes early , and avoid a huge mess in the main project.
                </p>
                <h4>Remote branches let others see your work</h4>
                <p>As a local branch is just on ones computer. Creating a remote branch by pushing the local branch to
                    a remote branch like GitHub allows the other members of the team or others who are interested to see
                    it and test it , and who knows, even contribute to it.
                </p>

            <section class="branching_commands">
                <h3>What are the git commands to create and close a branch?</h3>
                <h4> To create a new local branch from main / develop branch. It is always a good idea
                    to type git checkout main or git checkout develop , to ensure that you will be creating a local
                    branch from there.
                </h4>
                <h4>To create a new branch locally use </h4>
                <p> In your terminal, write
                    <span class="git_command">git branch nameofthebranch</span>
                    or <span class="git_command">git checkout -b nameofthebranch</span> to create and switch to this
                    newly created branch.
                </p>
                <h4>To close or delete a local branch </h4>
                <p>In your terminal, write
                    <span class="git_command">git branch -d nameofthebranch</span> , one might need to use <span
                        class="git_command"> -D </span>
                    if there are unmerged changes.
                </p>
                <h4>To close or delete a remote branch </h4>
                <p>In your terminal, write <span class="git_command">git push origin --delete
                        nameofthebranch</span></p>
