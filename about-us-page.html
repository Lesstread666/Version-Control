          <h2>Hi I am Vlad!</h2>
          <p>I'm from Russia and have been living in Sweden for 8 years. Back home, I danced at a high sports level and
            even earned the title of Candidate Master of Sports, but after moving here, I completely stopped since I
            didn't find a place to continue or coach.

            I spent 5 years studying Game Design at university in Sweden because I love creating games—especially as a
            gamer myself. In my free time, I sometimes hit the gym, binge series and movies, or dive into Dota (10k+
            hours… no big deal, right?). I also enjoy hanging out with friends, whether it's at a cozy bar or just
            relaxing at home together.
          </p>
          <h3>Why do you like frontend development?</h3>
          <p>Well, since school I always dreamed of being a programmer. Later I realized I also love creating
            things that people can see and interact with — kind of like how I used to make immersive game
            worlds. Frontend feels like a cool mix of both: I can still write code, but also make stuff that
            looks nice and has a bit of atmosphere.</p>

          <h2>Hi I am Imran!</h2>
          <p>I've been living in Sweden for a few years now. My background is in Computer Science, and I have always
            enjoyed learning new technologies and solving problems through coding. In my free time, I like exploring web
            development, listening to music, and spending time with my daughter she keeps life fun and full of
            surprises!
          </p>
          <h3>Why do you like frontend development?</h3>
          <p>Because it's where creativity meets logic. I love seeing my ideas come to life on screen and creating
            things people can interact with. It's like building something that not only works but also feels good to
            use. Every time a layout fits perfectly, or an animation flows smoothly it is a small victory that keeps me
            going!</p>
          <h3>If you have a special power, what would it be?</h3>
          <p>I would choose time control</p>

          <h2>Hi I am Michelle!</h2>
          <p>Hi, I am Michelle. I am originally from the Philippines and moved to Sweden at the end of 2019. I
            enjoy staying active by playing badminton for example and spending time with people, whether
            it's
            through bowling or catching up over a few drinks. But honestly, one of my favorite things to do especially
            if it's cold and dark outside, is just chill on the couch with a good series or movie
            (and
            a glass of wine, of course).
          </p>
          <h3>Why do you like frontend development?</h3>
          <p>I like frontend development because it combines my love for design and my passion for coding. I
            find
            it fascinating to create interfaces or features that not only look great but are also useful and
            engaging. When I say passion for coding I really mean writing code that comes to life ”visually”
            ,
            as seeing users interact with something I have made makes the work feel more meaningful. I think
            Frontend development lets me bridge creativity and logic/problem solving , turning ideas and
            designs
            to things that people can see and interact with.</p>
          <h3>If you have a special power, what would it be?</h3>
          <p>Ability to create anything I can imagine</p>
