          <h2>Hi I am Vlad!</h2>
          <p>I came to Sweden about 7 years ago and spent 5 of them studying Game Design. In my free time, I
            usually watch series or play games (10k+ hours in Dota... totally chill, right?). But if someone
            invites me to hang out ‚Äî I‚Äôm usually down for it!
          </p>
          <h3>Why do you like frontend development?</h3>
          <p>Well, since school I always dreamed of being a programmer. Later I realized I also love creating
            things that people can see and interact with ‚Äî kind of like how I used to make immersive game
            worlds. Frontend feels like a cool mix of both: I can still write code, but also make stuff that
            looks nice and has a bit of atmosphere.</p>

          <h2>Hi I am Michelle!</h2>
          <p>Hi, I am Michelle. I am originally from the Philippines and moved to Sweden at the end of 2019. I
            enjoy staying active by playing badminton for example and spending time with people, whether
            it's
            through bowling or catching up over a few drinks. But honestly, especially when it's cold and
            dark
            outside, one of my favorite things to do is just chill on the couch with a good series or movie
            (and
            a glass of wine, of course).
          </p>
          <h3>Why do you like frontend development?</h3>
          <p>I like frontend development because it combines my love for design and my passion for coding. I
            find
            it fascinating to create interfaces or features that not only look great but are also useful and
            engaging. When I say passion for coding I really mean writing code that comes to life ‚Äùvisually‚Äù
            ,
            as seeing users interact with something I have made makes the work feel more meaningful. I think
            Frontend development lets me bridge creativity and logic/problem solving , turning ideas and
            designs
            to things that people can see and interact with.</p>
